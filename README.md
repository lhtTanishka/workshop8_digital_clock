This Digital Clock project is a simple web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time in a 24-hour format and updates every second. The HTML provides the structure of the clock, while CSS is used to style and create a modern, clean design that is also responsive across different screen sizes. JavaScript is responsible for fetching the current time and ensuring the clock updates in real-time. To use the clock, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in a browser to view the clock.
